# Data Visualization Dashboard

Dashboards are designed to support a specific process or a set of goals. By surfacing data using appropriate, easy-to-digest visualizations, the dashboard provides key information at a glance, without the need for extensive interactivity.

There are currently many tools that can be used to create dashboards. From what I've done, I often use R shiny which is one of the packages from the R language, Tableau and Metabase.

Here are some dashboards that I have created either for the company I work for or for myself.



## R shiny Dashboard
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications directly from R. We can host standalone applications on web pages or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. We can also extend our Shiny application with CSS themes, html widgets, and JavaScript actions.

This is a dashboard that displays stock inventory, production output, and OEE (Overall equipment effectiveness) data.

*note : OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is the gold standard for measuring manufacturing productivity.*

### SPC (Statistical Process Control)
Not only did I display a chart of the data, I also created an SPC chart.
The term "statistical process control" (SPC) refers to the application of statistical methods for process or production method control.
